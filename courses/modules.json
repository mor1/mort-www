It is difficult to describe the content of these projects and dissertation since each represents an individual piece of work. In general students spend Semesters 5 and 6 working on their projects, with the final dissertation normally to be handed in at the end of Semester 6. For UK students visiting European Institutions under the Erasmus exchange scheme, however, it is possible to work on their project abroad entirely in the sixth semester. They will also be expected to take one course to count 10 credits while abroad. It also means that they must take 70 credits worth of taught CS courses in semester 5. The dissertation should represent a deep and analytical piece of writing exploring key issues tackled during the work and can be submitted in English or the language of the visited.

Its main goal is to provide a good knowledge of computational structures and sophisticated algorithms to tackle complex programming tasks. We study the theory behind some advanced data structures and algorithms on them and we learn how to implement them as functional and procedural programs (using the language Haskell and C). Knowledge of basic data types, linked lists, binary search trees, graphs, and of standard algorithms on them is assumed as a prerequisite. No previous knowledge of functional programming is required. All the needed basic notions and programming construct are taught as part of the module. We begin with a review of simple data types and algorithms and the study of their efficiency: big-Oh notation, recurrence relations and other supporting mathematics. We use them as case studies to learn the basics of functional programming. Next we consider more advanced data structures. These include leftist heaps, binomial heaps, red-black trees, Bloom filters, cuckoo hashing, etc. We also study advanced analysis techniques for the efficiency of algorithms, specifically amortised complexity, and techniques for proving lower bounds in data structure problems, in particular communication complexity.","target":"Students on the MSc Advanced Computing Science and MSci Computer Science Part III.

Such advancements have significant cost implications, enabling designs and their implications to be visualised early in the development lifecycle. This module will provide students with the knowledge and skills required to understand and utilise computers as Human Factors tools for modelling people and systems (tasks, interfaces, environments). The module is largely practically-oriented and students will make extensive use of digital human modelling software (e.g. Jack) and the simulation facilities (e.g. car, motorcycle and train simulators) available within the Human Factors Research Group.The syllabus covers:  Algorithms and use of avatars for modelling human physical characteristics (e.g. body dimensions, static and dynamic postures); Modelling of perceptual and cognitive variability (e.g. sensory abilities, emotive responses); Virtual reality technologies/environments; Validity of simulators; Presence factors for simulation; Understanding and minimising simulator sickness; Case studies in the use of digital human modelling and simulators as Human Factors tools.Module Web Links:Moodle(Web CT)","target":"MSc in Human Factors, BEng and MEng Product Design and Manufacture, MSc Human-Computer Interaction, MSc BioEngineering, any 3rd or 4th year student in Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering.","title":"Simulation and Digital Human Modelling","url":"http://modulecatalogue.nottingham.ac.uk/Nottingham/asp/moduledetails.asp?year_id=000113&crs_id=020105","year":"13/14"},{"url":"http://modulecatalogue.nottingham.ac.uk/Nottingham/asp/moduledetails.asp?year_id=000113&crs_id=undefined","year":"There were no modules found that matched your search criteria"},{"activities":[{"code":"N11116/L1/01","day":"Monday","end":"17:00","room":"JC-EXCHGE-D.LT3","size":"320","start":"15:00","type":"Lecture","weeks":"w19- w/c Mon 27/01/14-w29- w/c Mon 07/04/14"}],"aims":"To develop an understanding of important economic concepts.","code":"N11116","convenors":["Dr M Haynes"],"coreqs":[],"credits":10,"level":"1","outcomes":"Knowledge and understandingThis module develops a knowledge and understanding of:","prereqs":["N11604"],"school":"Business School","summary":"Exchange and Trade,  Gains from trade,  Absolute and Comparative advantage,  Tariffs, quotasConsumer Theory,  Indifference Analysis,  Attributes approach to Demand AnalysisMarket Failure,  Externality,  Public Goods,  Asymmetric Information,  Common ResourcesFactor markets,  Labour markets","target":"Not available to non Business School students apart from Geography with Business students.

Random variables are introduced, including definitions and manipulations involving mass, density and distribution functions, and expectation and variance. Standard discrete and continuous random variables are presented. A number of additional topics are considered, such as sums of random variables, simple transformations of random variables, bivariate discrete random variables, and an introduction to the central limit theorem.

The idea of error-correcting codes is to add redundancy to the message so that the receiver can recover the correct message even from a corrupted transmission. The module will concentrate on linear error-correcting codes (such as Hamming codes), where encoding, decoding and error correction can be done efficiently through syndrome look-up tables. We will also discuss cyclic codes, which are the ones most frequently used in practice.In cryptography, the aim is to transmit a message such that an unauthorised person cannot read it. The message is encrypted and decrypted using some method, called a cipher system. There are two main types of ciphers: private and public key ciphers. Among the private key ciphers, we will discuss basic monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers (and attacks on them), as well as the more advanced DES and AES.  For public key cryptography, the module will cover RSA and Elgamal and the elementary properties from number theory needed for them.

It shows the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals, and it can be used to  prove that one cannot square the circle, duplicate a cube, nor trisect an angle using only ruler and compass!We start by laying a theoretical foundation to the construction of splitting fields, and thence the factorization of polynomials. The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory lies at the heart of the module, and shows a close connection between field theory and group theory: we show how the question of solvability of a polynomial can be completely settled using group theory. Another topic will concern finite fields, which are of central importance in many applications including coding and cryptography.  Number fields form another large class of fields which, on the one hand, are sufficiently simple so as to allow an initial study by elementary methods, and, on the other hand, are sufficiently rich in structure  to represent all major aspects of Galois theory. Number fields will be used for illustration purposes throughout, and some of them, e.g. cyclotomic fields, are studied in detail. The principal objectives of studying Galois Theory are not only its applications, but also the appreciation of the beauty of a single brilliant idea.","target":"Single and Joint Honours students and Pure Mathematics MSc students from the School of Mathematical Sciences.

Already encountered key examples of commutative rings are polynomials in one variable over a field and number rings such as the usual integers or the Gaussian integers.  There are many close parallels between these two types of rings, for example the similarities between the prime factorization of integers and the factorization of polynomials into irreducibles. In this module, these ideas are extended and generalized to cover polynomials in several variables and power series, and algebraic numbers.
