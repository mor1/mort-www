History
=======

In 2001 I completed my Ph.D., ''[Internet Traffic Engineering][phd]''
with the [Systems Research Group][srg] at the [University of
Cambridge][ucam] [Computer Laboratory][cucl].  Since then I have
worked as a researcher with the [IP Group][ipgroup], [Sprint
ATL][atl]; the [Systems &amp; Networking Group][camsys], [Microsoft
Research Cambridge][msrc]; and most recently I was founder at [Vipadia
Limited][vipadia].

Outside work I practice [Wudang Tai Chi Chuan][wudang], and taught for
the [Cambridge University Tai Chi Chuan Society][cutccs] for several
years.  I am also a keen, if woefully out-of-practice, classical
guitarist.

[Vipadia][vipadia]
=======

I left Microsoft to become founder at [Vipadia Limited][vipadia], a
small voice-on-IP consultancy based near Cambridge.  With my
co-founder I designed and implemented the company's two main products:

- [Karaka][], a scalable standards-compliant Skype-XMPP gateway
- [Clackpoint][], a protocol-agnostic real-time collaboration platform
  bridging the Web, PSTN, Skype and Google Talk networks, enabling
  third-parties to build multi-party text, audio and video
  communications into their applications and websites

Clackpoint was written up in [TechCrunch][] and on Google's [SocialWeb
Blog][socialweb].  Two months after launch it had been installed on
around 1000 websites, was serving 6000 users/day (120,000
unique/month) from over 180 countries, and handling over 600,000
minutes/month.  Acquisition of both Clackpoint and Karaka by [Voxeo
Corp.][voxeo] was [announced][] in January 2010.

I also undertook contracted development for several clients on a range
of topics including integration of CTI with Microsoft Dynamics;
website development in Python/Django; and telephone control of home
automation systems.

[Microsoft Research][msrc]
==================

I was a permanent researcher for several years at [Microsoft's
Cambridge research lab][msrc].  With the [Systems and Networking
group][camsys] I worked on several projects:
- [Magpie][]: automated distributed system performance analysis
- [Anemone][]: host-based enterprise network management
- [Seaweed][]: massively scalable (&gt;50k nodes) peer-to-peer databases
- [Constellation][]: automated model construction for network service
  behaviour and dependency

[Seaweed]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/seaweed/
[Constellation]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/constellation/

In addition I was responsible for organising and implementing
collection of the first large-scale enterprise network trace.  This
comprised 2 years of OSPF routing data, and collection of around 13
billion packets over 4 weeks from Microsoft's corporate backbone
network.  I also developed the F# parsing library used to process
these traces.

[Sprint ATL][atl]
==========

Following my Ph.D., I spent several months with the [IP
Group][ipgroup] at [Sprint's Advanced Technology Lab][atl] in
California.  While there I produced [software][pyrt] to collect and
analyse routing data from _[Sprintlink][sprintlink]_, Sprint's tier-1 IP backbone,
running live for over 3 years without problems.  This code and data
found many uses, notably some of the earliest published analyses of
the [link failure][linkfail] and [routing loop][loops] behaviour of
large IP networks.  I also worked with the systems group on topics
ranging from [predicate routing][predrt] to [novel network management
techniques][infospect].
