========

Personal Containers are an experiment in enabling you to collate and
control your digital footprint.  At the moment the focus is on
collecting and managing your own data; future goals include developing
ways to enable others to interact with your data for mutual benefit,
while still retaining ultimate control yourself.

I developed the Python Routeing Toolkit while at Sprint ATL.  It
comprises code for collecting and analysing ISIS and BGP protocol
activity.  The original release is at
<https://research.sprintlabs.com/pyrt/> but it does not appear to be
maintained, unlike my [github hosted version][pyrt].
