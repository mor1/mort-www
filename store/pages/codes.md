## Codes

[Perscon][]
========

Personal Containers are an experiment in enabling you to collate and
control your digital footprint.  At the moment the focus is on
collecting and managing your own data; future goals include developing
ways to enable others to interact with your data for mutual benefit,
while still retaining ultimate control yourself.  The code is
available under the GPLv2.

[Homework][homework-git]
========

This is an experiment using [Open vSwitch][ovs] and [NoX][] to control
a wireless Linux access point as part of the wider [Homework][]
project.  The repository contains snapshots of both Open vSwitch and
NoX (as `git` *submodules* no less), as well as the Homework specific
control script which currently provides basic PERMIT/DENY
functionality based on MAC address and exposed via a simple web
services interface.

[PyRT][]
=====

I developed the Python Routeing Toolkit while at Sprint ATL, who
released it under the GPLv2.  It comprises code for collecting and
analysing routeing data.  This package currently collects BGPv4 and
ISIS, and dumps and parses MRTD files including MRTD TABLE_DUMP files
(as available from, e.g., RouteViews and RIPE/RIS).  A number of
utilities for manipulating these dumps are also provided.  Since the
code on [Sprint's website][pyrt] appears to be orphaned, I have
created a [github repository here][pyrt-gh] for it.

[Karaka][]
======

Developed at Vipadia Limited, this is a scalable software system
implementing a distributed Skype-XMPP gateway released under the
GPLv2.  Copyright was acquired by Voxeo Corp. in January 2010.
