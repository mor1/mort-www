Hello!
======

I'm Richard Mortier or, more commonly, **mort**.  I'm one of the
Horizon Transitional Fellows in Computer Science at the [Horizon
Institute][horizon], based here in the [University of
Nottingham][nottingham] [School of Computer Science][cs].

Research
========

My research interests span a range of topics, all with a networked
systems angle.  Due to the breadth of the Horizon Digital Economy
programme of work, in addition to my primary projects below
I'm also involved to a greater or lesser extent in projects spanning
topics from mixed reality urban games to use of bio-sensing in TV
production to infrastructure support for tracking physical objects
ranging from tableware to smart buildings.

[Dataware](research/dataware/)
------------------------------
is a framework to enable individuals to give controlled access to
their personal data for processing by third parties.  This will
provide the basic infrastructure on which we can build a socially
acceptable personal data marketplace. 

[Homework](http://www.homenetworks.ac.uk/)
------------------------------------------
is taking a comprehensive look at the problems users face in
managing their home network infrastructure.  [We've built a novel
Linux-based home router](https://github.com/homework/) using a custom
monitoring platform and a control infrastructure built using [Open
vSwitch][ovs] and [NOX][]. 

[Mirage](http://www.openmirage.org)
-----------------------------------
is an exokernel for constructing secure, high-performance network
applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms.
Code is developed in OCaml on a normal OS such as Linux or MacOS X,
and then compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised microkernel
that runs under the Xen hypervisor.

Expertise
========= 

I have worked on topics from distributed system performance monitoring
and debugging, to Internet routing protocols, to real-time media
platform design and implementation.  I have worked in a variety of
roles, from high-level platform architect, to designer and implementer
of complex networked systems, to website designer and builder.  I have
consulted and worked for a broad range of companies, including
startups ([&mu;][vipadia], [S][camrivox], [M][cplane], [L][alertme])
and corporates ([M][sprint], [L][microsoft]) in both the US and UK.  

I am currently available for consultancy and selected development work.
