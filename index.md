Hello!

Research
========

My current research interests centre around controlling our _digital
footprints_, the trail of information we leave as we interact in the
digital world.  I am interested in the system support required to
enable you to understand and manage digital information generated by
and about you.  This encompasses a variety of challenges in
information privacy, cloud computing, database systems, and usability.
Some first steps along these lines can be found at
<http://perscon.net>.

Expertise
========= 

I have worked on a wide range of systems and network topics, from
distributed system performance monitoring and debugging, to Internet
routing protocols, to real-time media platform design and
implementation.  I have worked in a variety of roles, from high-level
platform architecture to detailed implementation of complex networked
systems to website designer and implementer.  I am available for
consultancy and selected development work.
