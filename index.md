Hello!

Research
========

My current research interests centre around collating, managing,
controlling and exploiting our _digital footprints_, the trail of
information we leave as we interact in the digital world.  This
encompasses a variety of challenges in information privacy, cloud
computing, database systems, and usability.  Some first steps along
these lines can be found at <http://perscon.net>.

Expertise
========= 

I have worked on a wide range of systems and network topics, from
distributed system performance monitoring and debugging, to Internet
routing protocols, to real-time media platform design and
implementation.  I have worked in a variety of roles, from high-level
platform architect, to designer and builder complex networked
systems, to website designer and implementer.  I have consulted and
worked for a broad range of companies, including startups
([&mu;][vipadia], [S][camrivox], [M][cplane], [L][alertme]) and
corporates ([M][sprint], [L][microsoft]) in both the US and UK.  I am
available for consultancy and selected development work.
