Hello!
======

I'm Richard Mortier or, more commonly, **mort**. I'm one of the Horizon
Transitional Fellows in Computer Science at the [Horizon Institute][horizon],
based here in the [University of Nottingham][nottingham]
[School of Computer Science][cs]. I'm also a founding member of the [School's][cs] [Networked Systems Group][nsg].

Expertise
========= 

My [research](research) spans a range of topics, all with a networked
systems angle.  I have worked on topics from distributed system
performance monitoring and debugging, to Internet routing protocols,
to real-time media platform design and implementation.  I have worked
in a variety of roles, from high-level platform architect, to designer
and implementer of complex networked systems, to website designer and
builder.  I have consulted and worked for a broad range of companies,
including startups ([&mu;][vipadia], [S][camrivox], [M][cplane],
[L][alertme]) and corporates ([M][sprint], [L][microsoft]) in both the
US and UK.

I am currently available for consultancy and selected development work.
