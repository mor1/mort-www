## Expertise

I have worked on topics from distributed system performance monitoring and debugging, to Internet routing protocols, to real-time media platform design and implementation. I have worked in a variety of roles, from high-level platform architect, to designer and implementer of complex networked systems, to website designer and builder. I have consulted and worked for a broad range of companies, including startups ([&mu;][vipadia], [S][camrivox], [M][cplane], [L][alertme]) and corporates ([M][sprint], [L][microsoft]) in both the US and UK.

I occasionally undertake consultancy and selected development work -- [contact me](mailto:richard.mortier@nottingham.ac.uk?subject=%5Bwebsite%20enquiry%5D) if desired.

## Background

In 2001 I completed my Ph.D., "[Internet Traffic Engineering][phd]" with the [Systems Research Group][srg] at the [University of Cambridge][ucam] [Computer Laboratory][cucl]. Since then I have worked as a researcher with the [IP Group][ipgroup], [Sprint ATL][atl]; the [Systems &amp; Networking Group][camsys], [Microsoft Research Cambridge][msrc]; and most recently I was founder at [Vipadia Limited][vipadia].

Outside work I practice [Wudang Tai Chi Chuan][wudang], and taught for the [Cambridge University Tai Chi Chuan Society][cutccs] for several years. I am also a keen, if woefully out-of-practice, classical guitarist.
