I am interested in computing infrastructures, specifically networked systems. In
the past I have done extensive work on topics including
[routing behaviour in backbone networks][pyrt],
[future network architectures][plutarch],
[performance analysis and modelling of distributed systems][magpie],
[enterprise network management][anemone], and
[analysis of network topologies][wsd]. Most recently I have become interested in
interdisciplinary research and particularly the interplay between networked
systems and topics that traditionally fall under human-computer interaction. For
example,

+ how can we build usable _[home networking infrastructure][homework]_?
+ how can we increase legibility of current and future information
  infrastructures, supporting _[human-data interaction][hdi]_?
+ how can we rebuild infrastructures to support users deploying
  _[personal clouds][mirage]_?
+ how can we build systems that are _ethical by design_?

I try to maintain [a complete list of my publications][papers] in addition to
the usual sites including [Google Scholar][scholar],
[Microsoft Academic][microsoft], [CiteULike][] and the [ACM DL][acm-dl].

Any funded places that I have will be advertised via the [University][jobs].
Please read any adverts there carefully -- funding eligibility requirements
often mean that studentships are only accessible by UK/EU students. If you are
interested in applying to undertake a Ph.D. with me, before I can consider your
request I will need to see the following:

+ Your CV and research proposal -- I need to know what you want to do before we
  can discuss whether I'd be an appropriate choice of supervisor!
+ An indication of how you expect to be funded -- unfortunately nothing is free,
  including Ph.D. study.

I will not respond to enquiries that do not provide this information.
