I am interested in computing infrastructures, specifically networked systems. In
the past I have done extensive work on topics including
[routing behaviour in backbone networks][pyrt],
[future network architectures][plutarch],
[performance analysis and modelling of distributed systems][magpie],
[enterprise network management][anemone], and
[analysis of network topologies][wsd]. Most recently I have become interested in
interdisciplinary research and particularly the interplay between networked
systems and topics that traditionally fall under human-computer interaction. For
example,

+ how can we build usable _[home networking infrastructure][homework]_?
+ how can we increase legibility of current and future information
  infrastructures, supporting _[human-data interaction][hdi]_?
+ how can we rebuild infrastructures to support users deploying
  _[personal clouds][mirage]_?
+ how can we build systems that are _ethical by design_?

I try to maintain [a complete list of my publications][papers] in addition to
the usual sites including [Google Scholar][scholar],
[Microsoft Academic][microsoft], [CiteULike][] and the [ACM DL][acm-dl].

<h2 data-magellan-destination="projects" id="projects">Projects</h2>

I am actively involved in a number of current projects, including:

+ [Databox](http://databoxproject.uk/), building infrastructure to support us
  all in managing our personal data.
+ [Contrive](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N028422/1),
  supporting
  the
  [HAT](http://hubofallthings.com) [Living Labs](http://hubofallthings.com/hall/).
+ [Networks as a Service](http://www.naas-project.org/), exploring how to
  provide application control over network resources, down to programmable
  hardware.
* [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/), developing the OCaml unikernel, Mirage.
* [Artcodes](http://aestheticodes.com/), developing beautiful, machine-readable
  codes.

Completed past projects include:

+ [UCN](http://usercentricnetworking.eu/)
+ [Homework](http://homenetworks.ac.uk/)
+ [PAWS (Public Access WiFi Service](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K012703/1)

at
[Grants of the Web](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=-140023).


<h2 data-magellan-destination="students" id="students">Students</h2>

Any funded places that I have will be advertised via the [University][jobs].
Please read any adverts there carefully -- funding eligibility requirements
often mean that studentships are only accessible by UK/EU students. If you are
interested in applying to undertake a Ph.D. with me, before I can consider your
request I will need to see the following:

+ Your CV and research proposal -- I need to know what you want to do before we
  can discuss whether I'd be an appropriate choice of supervisor!
+ An indication of how you expect to be funded -- unfortunately nothing is free,
  including Ph.D. study.

I will not respond to enquiries that do not provide this information.
