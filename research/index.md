Research
========

The breadth of the Horizon Digital Economy Research programme of work
means that I'm involved to a greater or lesser extent in a wide range
of projects.  I list my primary projects below, but others span topics
from mixed reality urban games to use of bio-sensing in TV production
to infrastructure support for tracking physical objects ranging from
tableware to smart buildings.  

For a complete list of my publications, [click here](../papers/).

[Dataware](http://perscon.net/overview/dataware.html)
====

is a framework to enable individuals to give controlled access to
their personal data for processing by third parties.  This will
provide the basic infrastructure on which we can build a socially
acceptable personal data marketplace.  This work is taking place
within the context of the [Personal Containers](http://perscon.net/)
project.  

[Homework](http://www.homenetworks.ac.uk/)
====

is taking a comprehensive look at the problems users face in
managing their home network infrastructure.  [We've built a novel
Linux-based home router](https://github.com/homework/) using a custom
monitoring platform and a control infrastructure built using [Open
vSwitch][ovs] and [NOX][]. 

[Mirage](http://www.openmirage.org)
====

is an exokernel for constructing secure, high-performance network
applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms.
Code is developed in OCaml on a normal OS such as Linux or MacOS X,
and then compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised microkernel
that runs under the Xen hypervisor.
