Following the success of the first W-MUST workshop at SIGCOMM 2011, we are
holding a second workshop this year. W-MUST aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners in the networking and HCI communities to share new ideas and
experiences addressing the challenges of measuring networked applications on
end-user platforms for purposes related to performance, privacy, security,
diagnosis, and troubleshooting. We are particularly interested in gathering
context related to user activity or reflecting measurement-derived information
to users. Work that solely considers network-level traces is out of
scope. This workshop encourages work toward understanding how to gather the
user view and correlate it with lower-level measurements. 

We solicit short papers describing positions and work-in-progress that will
generate lively discussion. Topics of interest include, but are not limited
to: 

+ Incentivizing and providing feedback to users. 
+ Techniques for gathering individual user perspectives during measurement. 
+ Sampling users in the face of unpredictability.
+ Data collection techniques that respect personalised user privacy.
+ Correlating user experience with low level measurements.
+ Disambiguating intentional from unintentional network activity.
+ Disambiguating user-generated from non-user generated activity.
+ Combining user, application, and network measurements on smartphone
  platforms. 
+ Exposing hidden activities, on the network and in the cloud, to users.
+ Understanding tradeoffs in host data collection between performance impact
  and data quality.
+ Annotating measurement of peoples' use of networked applications with
  context. 
+ Optimising network and system resources via context-aware user profiles.
+ Quantifying user experience with both network-centric and user-centric
  metrics. 
+ Integration of formal and informal user-centric methodologies into
  measurement. 

Submissions must be as PDF files no longer than 6 pages in length. They must
include the authors' names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by
