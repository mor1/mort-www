In particular, it is increasingly clear that the Internet and other networks built on the Internet protocol suite do not provide sufficient support for the efficient control and management of traffic, i.e. for Traffic Engineering.  This dissertation addresses the problem of traffic engineering in the Internet. It argues that traffic management techniques should be applied at multiple timescales, and not just at data timescales as is currently the case. It presents and evaluates mechanisms for traffic engineering in the Internet at two further timescales: flow admission control and control of per-flow packet marking, enabling control timescale traffic engineering; and support for load based inter-domain routeing in the Internet, enabling management timescale traffic engineering.  This dissertation also discusses suitable policies for the application of the proposed mechanisms. It argues that the proposed mechanisms are able to support a wide range of policies useful to both users and operators.  Finally, in a network of the size of the Internet consideration must also be given to the deployment of proposed solutions. Consequently, arguments for and against the deployment of these mechanisms are presented and the conclusion drawn that there are a number of feasible paths toward deployment.  The work presented argues the following: firstly, it is possible to implement mechanisms within the Internet framework that enable traffic engineering to be carried out by operators; secondly, that applying these mechanisms with suitable policies can ease the management problems faced by operators and at the same time improve the efficiency with which the network can be run; thirdly, that these improvements can correspond to increased network performance as viewed by the user; and finally, that not only the resulting deployment but also the deployment process itself are feasible.", "author": ["Richard Mortier"], "number": "UCAM-CL-TR-532", "month": "April", "note": "Ph.D. Dissertation", "year": "2002", "_venue": "techreport", "institution": "University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory"}, "iannacone02:_analy_of_link_failur_in_ip_backb": {"_type": "inproceedings", "title": "Analysis of Link Failures in an IP Backbone", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Workshop (IMW)", "author": ["Gianluca Iannacone", "Chen-Nee Chuah", "Richard Mortier", "Supratik Bhattacharyya", "Christophe Diot"], "publisher": "ACM", "month": "November", "note": "Short paper.

However, it does not provide all the capabilities required of a multi-service network. In particular, although resource-assured VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) can be created, there is no provision for inter-VPN resource management. Control flexibility is limited because resources must be pinned down to be guaranteed, and best-effort flows in different VPNs compete for the same resources, leading to QoS crosstalk.  The contribution of this paper is an implementation on MPLS of a network control framework that supports inter-VPN resource management. Using resource partitions known as switchlets, it allows the creation of multiple VPNs with guaranteed resource allocations, and maintains isolation between these VPNs. Devolved control techniques permit each VPN a customised control system.  We motivate our work by discussing related efforts and example scenarios of effective deployment of our system.  The implementation is described and evaluated, and we address interoperability with external IP control systems, in addition to interoperability of data across different layer 2 technologies.", "author": ["Richard Mortier", "Rebecca Isaacs", "Keir Fraser"], "number": "UCAM-CL-TR-510", "month": "May", "year": "2000", "_venue": "techreport", "institution": "University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory"}, "mcauley11:_dataw_manif": {"_type": "inproceedings", "title": "The Dataware Manifesto", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)", "author": ["Derek McAuley", "Richard Mortier", "James Goulding"], "year": "2011", "days": "4", "month": "January", "note": "Invited paper", "address": "Bangalore, India", "keywords": "Federation, distributed computing, value chain.", "_venue": "conference", "abstract": "In this paper we concern ourselves with Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) in the business to consumer (B2C) arena.

We use a variety of topological metrics to analyze the structural differences revealed in the AS topologies inferred from the two different datasets. In particular, to focus on the evolution of the relationship between the core and the periphery, we make use of the weighted spectral distribution.  We find that the traceroute dataset has increasing difficulty in sampling the periphery of the AS topology, largely due to limitations inherent to active probing. Such a dataset has too limited a view to properly observe topological changes at the AS-level compared to a dataset largely based on BGP data. We also highlight limitations in current measurements that require a better sampling of particular topological properties of the Internet. Our results indicate that the Internet is changing from a core-centered, strongly customer-provider oriented, disassortative network, to a soft-hierarchical, peering-oriented, assortative network.", "author": ["Hamed Haddadi", "Damien Fay", "Steve Uhlig", "Andrew W.

However, this openness permits many abuses of open-access Internet services such as web, email, and DNS. To counteract such abuses, a number of so called proof-of-work schemes have been proposed. They aim to prevent or limit such abuses by demanding potential clients of the service to prove that they have carried out some amount of work before they will be served. In this paper we show that existing resource-based schemes have several problems, and instead propose latency-based proof-of-work as a solution. We describe centralised and distributed variants, introducing the problem class of non-parallelisable shared secrets in the process.

Comparing graphs requires a metric to discriminate which features of the graphs are considered important. The spectrum of a graph is often claimed to contain all the information within a graph, but the raw spectrum contains too much information to be directly used as a useful metric. In this paper we introduce a metric, the weighted spectral distribution, that improves on the raw spectrum by discounting those eigenvalues believed to be unimportant and emphasizing the contribution of those believed to be important.  We use this metric to optimize the selection of parameter values for generating Internet topologies. Our metric leads to parameter choices that appear sensible given prior knowledge of the problem domain: the resulting choices are close to the default values of the topology generators and, in the case of the AB generator, fall within the expected region. This metric provides a means for meaningfully optimizing parameter selection when generating topologies intended to share structure with, but not match exactly, measured graphs.", "author": ["Damien Fay", "Hamed Haddadi", "Steve Uhlig", "Andrew Moore", "Richard Mortier", "Almerima Jamakovic"], "number": "UCAM-CL-TR-729", "month": "September", "year": "2008", "_venue": "techreport", "institution": "University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory"}, "karagiannis08:_addres_and_traff_dynam_in": {"_type": "inproceedings", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LANMAN.2008.4675852", "title": "Address and traffic dynamics in a large enterprise network", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th IEEE Workshop on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)", "author": ["Thomas Karagiannis", "Richard Mortier"], "publisher": "IEEE", "month": "September", "year": "2008", "_venue": "workshop", "pages": "102--107", "address": "Chij-Napoca, Transylvania"}, "mortier06:_seaweed": {"_type": "inproceedings", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDEW.2006.132", "title": "Seaweed: Distributed Scalable Ad Hoc Querying", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering: NetDB Workshop", "author": ["Richard Mortier", "Dushyanth Narayanan", "Austin Donnelly", "Antony Rowstron "], "publisher": "IEEE Computer Society", "month": "April", "year": "2006", "_venue": "workshop", "pages": "30", "address": "Atlanta, GA, USA"}, "roscoe03:_predic_routin": {"_type": "article", "issn": "0146-4833", "title": "Predicate routing: Enabling controlled networking", "journal": "ACM Computer Communication Review (CCR)", "author": ["Timothy Roscoe", "Steve Hand", "Rebecca Isaacs", "Richard Mortier", "Paul Jardetzky"], "publisher": "ACM", "number": "1", "month": "January", "volume": "33", "note": "Reprint of HOTNETS'02 workshop paper~\\citeroscoe02:_predic_routin.", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/774763.774773", "year": "2003", "_venue": "journal", "pages": "65--70", "address": "New York, NY, USA"}, "UCAM-CL-TR-725": {"_type": "techreport", "issn": "1476-2986", "title": "Beyond node degree: Evaluating AS topology models", "url": " http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-725.pdf", "abstract": "Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous System (AS) topologies, most of which make structural assumptions about the AS graph. In this paper we compare AS topology generation models with several observed AS topologies. In contrast to most previous works, we avoid making assumptions about which topological properties are important to characterize the AS topology. Our analysis shows that, although matching degree-based properties, the existing AS topology generation models fail to capture the complexity of the local interconnection structure between ASs. Furthermore, we use BGP data from multiple vantage points to show that additional measurement locations significantly affect local structure properties, such as clustering and node centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably affected by additional measurements locations.  These observations are particularly valid in the core.  The shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the core caused by inappropriate use of BGP data.", "author": ["Hamed Haddadi", "Damien Fay", "Almerima Jamakovic", "Olaf Maennel", "Andrew Moore", "Richard Mortier", "Miguel Rio", "Steve Uhlig"], "number": "UCAM-CL-TR-725", "month": "July", "year": "2008", "_venue": "techreport", "institution": "University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory"}, "fay10:_weigh_spect_distr_for_inter_topol_analy": {"_type": "article", "issn": "1063-6692", "title": "Weighted Spectral Distribution for Internet Topology Analysis: Theory and Applications", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON)", "author": ["Damien Fay", "Hamed Haddadi", "Andrew Thomason", "Andrew Moore", "Richard Mortier", "Almerima Jamakovic", "Steve Uhlig", "Miguel Rio"], "publisher": "IEEE Computer Society/IEEE Communications Society/Association for Computing Machinery", "number": "1", "month": "February", "volume": "18", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2022369", "year": "2010", "_venue": "journal", "pages": "164--176"}, "mortier11:_platf_palm_your_hand": {"_type": "inproceedings", "title": "Platforms in the Palm of Your Hand: Mobile Value Chain Evolution", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Business Models for Mobile Platforms -- Access and Competitiveness in Multi-Sided Markets (BMMP)", "author": ["Richard Mortier", "Catherine Mulligan"], "month": "oct # ~7", "year": "2011", "_venue": "workshop", "address": "Berlin, Germany"}, "20080103729": {"_type": "patent", "author": ["Paul Barham", "Richard Black", "Moises Goldszmidt", "Rebecca Isaacs", "John MacCormick", "Richard Mortier"], "url": "http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20080103729.html", "title": "DISTRIBUTED DETECTION WITH DIAGNOSIS", "number": "US20080103729(A1)", "month": "may # ~1", "note": "Filed October 31, 2006", "year": "2008", "_venue": "patents", "day": "1"}, "barham02:_techn_for_light_conceal_and": {"_type": "techreport", "author": ["Paul Barham", "Steven Hand", "Rebecca Isaacs", "Paul Jardetzky", "Richard Mortier", "Timothy Roscoe"], "title": "Techniques for Lightweight Concealment and Authentication in IP Networks", "number": "IRB-TR-02-009", "month": "July", "year": "2002", "_venue": "techreport", "institution": "Intel Research Berkeley, 2150 Shattuck Avenue, Suite 1300, Berkeley, CA 94704"}, "crowcroft03:_qoss_downf": {"_type": "inproceedings", "doi": "http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/944592.944594", "author": ["Jon Crowcroft", "Steve Hand", "Richard Mortier", "Timothy Roscoe", "Andrew Warfield"], "booktitle": "Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Revisiting IP QoS (RIPQOS)", "title": "QoS's Downfall: At the bottom or not at all!", "publisher": "ACM", "month": "August", "year": "2003", "_venue": "workshop", "pages": "190--114", "address": "Karlsruhe, Germany"}}}
