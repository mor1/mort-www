Dataware
========

+-- {.section}

Motivation
----------

More and more digital data is collected about you as you go about your
life, creating your digital footprint.  From prescriptions to loyalty
cards to social networking to your mobile phone, various businesses
and other organizations collect data your life: where you live and
shop, who you interact with, your health, and many others.  Your
digital footprint grows continually as the world becomes increasingly
network connected.  A key challenge of the digital economy is to build
the infrastructure that allows individuals to control how, when and by
whom this data is used.  

Solution
--------

__Dataware__ is the framework we are designing to enable this market
to come into existence.  Within this framework, your data is collected
and stored by both existing and new organizations and services. Via
your personal container, companies will be able to acquire permission
to perform specific processing on some or all of the data sources that
make up your datasphere.  By controlling the processing that can be
carried out, and by managing the permissions granted to data
processors, you exercise control over what happens to your data while
also becoming able to create new value from your digital footprint.

Impact
------

Availability of this infrastructure could significantly impact many
businesses, from advertisers and market researchers to service
providers.  For example, it may impose controls on those who've been
able to gather and process data relatively freely.  At the same time,
it will enable individuals to expose the richness of their personal
data to a market generating value both for the individual and the
business that processes it.
