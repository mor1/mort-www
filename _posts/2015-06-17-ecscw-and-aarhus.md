I have to confess to being quite pleased to having a couple of
[HDI](http://hdiresearch.org/)-related papers accepted recently (even if we
can't even get proper reviews on the
[original HDI paper](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508051) -- recently judged
out-of-scope for the third time, even though the Special Issue in question
seemed bang on target!).

The first is a full paper to [ECSCW'15](http://www.ecscw2015.no/) titled
[_Human Data Interaction: Historical Lessons from Social Studies and CSCW_](http://mor1.github.io/publications/pdf/ecscw15-hdi.pdf).
A collaboration with [Dr Andy Crabtree](http://www.andy-crabtree.com/), it
examines particularly the role of _interaction_ in HDI and explores how past
technical approaches, such as
[Dataware](http://mor1.github.io/publications/pdf/comsnets11-dataware.pdf), to
the challenges posed by HDI haven't fully considered the inherently social
nature of data.

The second is a short paper to the decennial -- seriously: every ten years! --
[Aarhus 2015](http://aarhus2015.org) conference titled
[_Personal Data: Thinking Inside the Box_](http://mor1.github.io/publications/pdf/aarhus15-databox.pdf).
This sets out a vision for an embodiment of a _Databox_: a physical device
supported by online services that empowers us to take back control of our online
lives. Building a Databox, using [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/), is hopefully
going to be a key activity for me in the coming months...
