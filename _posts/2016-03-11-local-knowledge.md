A relatively long hiatus this time -- blame the Cambridge housing market and the
need to simultaneously act both incredibly quickly and mind-numbingly slowly.
Also obtaining a
[College Fellowship](http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/content/dr-richard-mortier)
and experiencing a
[Company Acquisition](https://blog.docker.com/2016/01/unikernel/) were
considerable (interesting, welcome) distractions... :)

As an interim measure, and because I've been asked relatively frequently over
the last few months, I thought I'd collect some local knowledge^Wopinion,
garnered over many long hard years of hanging about in both Cambridge and
Nottingham. What follows should be viewed as indicating nothing more than my
lack of imagination.

Both Cambridge and Nottingham are blessed with many fine pubs, as well as
several truly terrible ones. Less said about the latter the better. But among
those that I like, and will occasionally drag various people to (including the
[SRG](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/)) are, arranged roughly in
geographical order from the Computer Lab to the Station:

+ [The Plough, Coton](http://www.theploughcoton.co.uk/). Gastro-pub-ish.
  Frequently changed management over recent years, but currently seems pretty
  consistent and (finally!) is not limited to Greene King beers.
+ [The Castle Inn](http://thecastleinncambridge.com/). Major long-standing
  Adnams "proper pub". Very consistent. Castle Burger and chips please.
+ [The Pickerel](http://www.taylor-walker.co.uk/pub/pickerel-cambridge/c3602/).
  Also largely unchanged in a couple of decades. Good for a pint before entering
  the Greene King desert.
+ [The Radegund](https://whatpub.com/pubs/CAM/184/st-radegund-cambridge).
  Tiniest pub I know of. Recently quite radically refurbished. But, while not
  what it was, seems pretty decent nonetheless.
+ [The Free Press](https://whatpub.com/pubs/CAM/79/free-press-cambridge). Has
  improved significantly while I was in Nottingham. Very good food and beer.
  Stocks the only actually pleasant Greene King beer
  ([XX Mild](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/greene-king-xx-mild/14879/)), as well
  as an interesting range of others. Quite small and often packed if it's too
  cold to sit outside.
+ [The Cambridge Blue](http://www.the-cambridgeblue.co.uk/). Surely one of the
  best pubs for many many miles. Excellent and huge range of beer (and,
  apparently, cider; won't touch the stuff myself). Good food. Large and with a
  large garden too -- rarely a problem finding somewhere to sit during the week.
+ [The Kingston Arms](http://www.kingston-arms.co.uk/). Another excellent pub in
  the station area. Possibly better food than the Blue, potentially slightly
  less wide ranging set of beers (and, certainly, ciders). Also a nice garden,
  though in all respects somewhat smaller than the Blue so prone to being
  absolutely packed. Doesn't serve lager -- a certain German colleague makes do
  with JHB though.
+ [The Live and Let Live](https://whatpub.com/pubs/CAM/118/live-let-live-cambridge).
  Yet one more excellent and, though small, often less busy pub near the
  station. No food in the evenings.
+ [The Devonshire Arms](https://www.individualpubs.co.uk/devonshire/). Largest
  range of Milton Brewery beers I know of. Food = pizzas I believe (though not,
  last time I tried, as good as those at
  [The Carpenters Arms](http://www.carpentersarmscambridge.co.uk/)).

I don't get out to the villages as often as I'd like now, but
[The Green Man, Grantchester](http://www.thegreenmangrantchester.co.uk/#the-green-man-grantchester),
[The Blue Lion, Hardwick](http://www.bluelionhardwick.co.uk/) and especially
[The Red Lion, Histon](http://theredlionhiston.co.uk/) are (or were last time I
went) all excellent too. The latter is still possibly my favourite pub anywhere
in fact.

I only spent a few years in Nottingham, and it's a Proper City unlike Cambridge,
so I can't claim to have tested it thoroughly. However, places I did visit
fairly regularly in Nottingham, Beeston, and Wollaton that I certainly enjoyed
include:

+ [The Roundhouse](http://www.theroundhousenottingham.co.uk/). A little pricey
  for Nottingham, but good quality beer and food, nice atmosphere.
+ [The Lincolnshire Poacher](http://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/lincolnshire-poacher/).
  Very excellent pub. Good whisky range too.
+ [Fellows, Morton & Clayton](http://www.fellowsmortonandclayton.co.uk/).
  Consistently good, proper pub food, about 4 minutes walk from the station
  platforms.
+ [The Vat & Fiddle](http://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/vat-and-fiddle/).
  Only finally tried more recently. Castle Rock brewery tap. Good food and beer,
  also about 4 minutes walk from your station platform.
+ [The Hand & Heart](http://www.thehandandheart.co.uk/). In a cave! It's a pub
  in a cave! With excellent beer and good food! And not owned by Greene King!
  (Unlike [Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem](http://triptojerusalem.com/) which has
  bigger, better caves but markedly less good beer or food.)
+ [The Organ Grinder](http://www.bluemonkeybrewery.com/pubs/organ-grinder-nottingham).
  Another fine pub at Canning Circus. Blue Monkey brewery this time -- rather
  good. Food limited to (nice!) pork pies and such, but the beer is good.
+ [The Plough Inn](http://www.nottinghambrewery.co.uk/the_plough_inn.html).
  Closest (decent) pub to Jubilee Campus. Nottingham City brewery tap. Excellent
  beer, no food in the evenings, and prices that make me think I'm 15 years
  younger...
+ [The Victoria Hotel, Beeston](http://www.victoriabeeston.co.uk/). Consistently
  excellent pub, Excellent beer, very good food.
+ [The Crown Inn, Beeston](http://www.everards.co.uk/our-pubs/crown-inn-beeston/).
  Also consistently excellent beer, though no food in the evenings.
+ [The Wollaton Pub and Kitchen, Wollaton](http://www.molefacepubcompany.co.uk/the-wollaton-pub-and-kitchen.html).
  Gastro-pub-ish. Generally good beer, often excellent food, occasionally
  patchy).

So there you go. Some opinions if relatively little knowledge. YMMV. Etc.

(PS. If I know you, I'll also be happy to give recommendations of solicitors,
builders and other house-associated professionals too. And a couple of
warnings.)
