And just because pixels are, in some loose sense, nearly free, here's the
abstract from the seminar link above:

_The increasing generation and collection of personal data has created a complex ecosystem, often collaborative but sometimes combative, around companies and individuals engaging in the use of these data. We propose that the interactions between these agents warrant a new topic of study: Human-Data Interaction (HDI), that sits at the intersection of various disciplines, including computer science, statistics, sociology, psychology and behavioural economics._

_In this brief presentation I will pose some of the challenges that HDI raises, organised into three core themes of legibility, agency and negotiability. I will also outline some of the technical work we are currently undertaking that attempts to address some of the underlying platform problems. My hope is to elicit discussion of both the HDI framework and the technical solutions we are pursuing, as well as to engage in a broader conversation about the ways we should approach the personal data ecosystem with other interested parties._
