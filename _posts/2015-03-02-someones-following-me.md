It's always[^1] nice when someone notices what you're doing, and I was
pleasantly surprised recently to find that someone had indeed been watching.[^2]

[^1]: Well, usually. Unless you're doing something embarrassing like, e.g.,
      dancing.

[^2]: Though in fact, given the pattern involved, I suspect it may be my
      colleague, [Dr Hamed Haddadi](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/) who's
      actually being followed. To whit, the fact that they also picked up on
      [a study](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/530741/the-murky-world-of-third-party-web-tracking/)
      of third-party web-tracking from last year.

Specifically, it appears that someone at MIT Technology Review has noticed the
work of me and some of my pals: our work on [HDI][] and a recent sketch of some
follow-on work we're pursuing around building a personal [Databox][].
Independently of that, the latter also happened to get picked up by
[John Naughton][naughton] in the [Guardian][], which ended up with a pretty
active comments thread, including one from Richard Stallman himself...

Guess we'd better get on and deliver it now then :)
