Turns out others were listening too -- notably the USA's [DARPA][]. The recent
announcement of the [Brandeis][] programme makes explicit reference to [HDI][]
and [our website][hdiwww]. This has been picked up by [GCN][], [USAToday][],
[NBCNews][], [Engadget][] among others. With $60M potentially on the table, I
hope that there'll be many more who get interested in pushing HDI forwards now
:)
