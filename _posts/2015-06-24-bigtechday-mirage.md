After a slew of HDI related items, a quick [MirageOS][] note. I was invited to
give a presentation on MirageOS at the [TNG](https://www.tngtech.com/en.html)
[Big TechDay 8](https://www.tngtech.com/en/big-techday.html) conference. This
was an interesting, and very broad based, event. It brought together about 500
people with about 25 speakers over one day, on topics from cognitive science to
AI to chess playing algorithms to obviating testing through proof reasoning.
And, of course, operating systems and [MirageOS][]! If you're interested, the
slides used are available at
[decks.openmirage.org](http://decks.openmirage.org/bigtechday8) in the usual
way, and if you really want to hear me droning on, TNG are making the video
(with synchronised slides)
[available](http://www.techcast.com/events/bigtechday8/salvator-1130/?q=salvator-1130).

As ever, comments welcome!
